After the sh file finishes printing out the locations and other info -> Pass .csv and the chosen state as input to the heat map generator.

Geocode locations
- Convert each beach/location name to latitude and longitude, because we don't have that information we would have to use the state to find its location

Prepare map data
- Create a list of coordinates for each shark attack.  from geocode location
- Optionally count attacks per location to adjust intensity.

Generate heat map: Use GeoPandas/Folium/Plotly to plot points on a map of USA:
- Each attack = a point 
- Gradient/heat intensity = number of attacks per location
- Overlay attack points as a heat map (intensity = number of attacks).

Display or save heat map
- Show interactive map in Jupyter Notebook. (best way in my opinion)
- Save as HTML for website interaction.

If time permits then make thw website or the map interactive by being able to add new data points
